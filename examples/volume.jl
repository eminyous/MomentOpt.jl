 Approximate the volume of a semi algebraic set with MomentOpt.jl.
 For theoretical background see : https://homepages.laas.fr/henrion/Papers/volume.pdf

 Let K ⊆ B ⊆ R^n be semialgebraic compact sets and the moments of a the Lebesgue meausre 
 on B be known. One is interested in computing the volume of K. This can be done by solving
 the Generalized Moment Problem

  max <μ,1>
 	μ + ν = λ
	μ ∈ M(K)
	ν ∈ M(B)
 where λ is the Lebesgue measure on B.

 The equality of measures can be understood in the weak sense, i.e,
	<μ,φ> + <ν,φ> = <λ,φ>
 for all test functions φ. 
 As B is compact one can choose the polynomials, or any basis of the space of polynomials as
 test functions. In the code below we choose the monomials as test functions. 

 When choosing the monomials up to a fixed degree as test functions, the dual problem reads

 min ∑p_α <λ,x^α>
     ∑p_αx^α ⩾ 1 on K
     ∑p_αx^α ⩾ 0 on B 

 i.e., the optimal polynomial p = ∑p_αx^α is an over approximation of the indicator function of 
 K on B.
